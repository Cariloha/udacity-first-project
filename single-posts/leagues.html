                        platforms, YouTube, or you local tv company. Adding that now the media is realizing something
                        they took a lot of tinme to realize, women's football sells and it's really profitable, there
                        are tons of women, children and also men that enjoy watching women's football.

                        After this breaf introduction, here are the leagues I follow and also recommend you if you
                        want to support women's football.

                            <h2>Liga BBVA femenil</h2>
                            <p>This league is from México, and it's a "young" league, their first edition was in
                                2017 and the first cup was won by Pachuca, and at the beggining there were two separate
                                groups 'A' and 'B'. After
                                aproximately two years they decided to merge the group into a one group where all teams
                                played against each other. It was in 2019 that the "liga" allowed foreig players into
                                the league, this would help to raise the competition level among the players.</p>
                            <p>The team that has won more cups is Tigres UANL femenil from Nuevo Leon, with 5 cups.</p>
                            <p>Next is Rayadas from Monterrey, Chivas from Guadalajara and América from CDMX.</p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>I was very impressed when I found out that there was a women's champions league, I heard
                                about it on the radio and I was truly exited, by that time it was almost imposible to
                                watch the games in my country, but I managed somehow to follow the matches. This year
                                YouTube channel DAZN have the rights to stream the matches in the league, so following
                                it will be easier (thank you DAZN).
                            </p>
                            <p>The best players globally are mostly in this league, the competition level is high and
                                their football is beautiful, the team that has won more cups is Olympic de Lyon, winning
                                6 cups. Barcelona is comming really strong this past year and PSG is also one of the
                                best teams in this league</p>

                            <p>I would dare to say that this is the most important league from America (the continent),
                                the best players from the continent are in this league. Most of the players in México
                                would love to play in the NWSL because this would increase their football skills. I
                                followed this league on twitch, but recently DAZN announced that they would also be
                                streaming this games (for some countries).
                            </p>
                            <p>This league started in 2013, and the team that has won more cups is Portland Thorns FC
                                with 3 cups, next is FC Kansas City with 2.</p>
