                    <p>I've been following football for a long time, when I was a child and started to play football I
                        didn't have a woman player as a role model to follow, back in the days we didn't have the media
                        covering professional women's players, so it was hard to keep track of them. I'm extremely happy
                        that nowadays is more common to watch national and international leagues thanks to the
                        internet and the streaming platforms. So, here are my top 3 football players around the world
                        (no specific order).

                            <h2>Lizbeth Ovalle</h2>
                            <p>Ovalle is a Mexican football player, she plays as a midfielder for Tigres UANL femenil
                                and she is
                                also a player for the México National Team. She is from Aguascalientes and she has 23
                                years old.
                                To me Ovalle is the <span class="underline">best</span> midfielder in México, we call
                                her "la
                                maga"
                                which means "the magician", because that is was she does, she does magic with her
                                football and her feet, watching her play is always a great show. I hope one day I can
                                meet her.
                            </p>
                            <p>She has a long journey ahead of her and I hope I can see her in the future playing in the
                                NSFW or in Europe, playing the Women's Champions</p>
                            <p>She has won five championships with Tigres UANL femenil</p>

                            <h2>Marta Vieira da Silva</h2>
                            <p>Marta is a brazilian professional football player who has inspired tons of girls across
                                the world, her story is very touching and the way she manage to persuit her dream of
                                become a professional player is admirable. When Marta was a child, she was told many
                                times that football was only for boys, and she must quit playing, but that didn't stop
                                her, when she was 20 years old she won FIFA's Best Player. She plays as a striker.
                            </p>
                            <p>To me Marta is one of the most iconic female player, because she stands up for women's
                                football rights, she has also scored on every Women's World Cup. On the last Women's
                                World Cup she said something that I really felt inside my soul.</p>
                            <p> <cite>
                                    “It's training more. It's taking care of yourself more. It's being ready to play
                                    ninety
                                    plus thirty minutes. This is
                                    what I ask of the girls. There's not going to be a Formiga forever. There's not
                                    going to
                                    be a Marta forever. There's not
                                    going to be a Cristiane. The women's game depends on you to survive.”

                                I was I child, and this is a great message for the new generation to hear.</p>
                            <p>Marta plays for the Orlando Pride team in USA and she is also selected with the Brazilian

                            <p>Megan is an American (from USA) football player, she is currently part of the OL Reign
                                team, her position is midfielder and she is a really good one, one of the bests
                                globally. She was a key player on the last Women's World Cup (2019), she is also
                                an activist for the LGTBI community, she stands by her ideals, she speaks up against
                                unfairness. She also plays for the USA National Team, one of the best teams of the
                                world. She seems to be a humble person with her feet on the ground.
                            </p>
                            <p>Rapinoe was part of the women's team's equal pay complaint to the Equal Employment
                                Opportunity Commission since 2016, where the female players were asking for equal pay as
                                their male companions, this is something that not many people understans, but the
                                National female team in USA have won more cups than the National male team, so it
                                doesn't makes sense that the National female team earns less than their male companions
